ohai. I'm thinking about fixing up this dumpster fire.

God knows why.

Don't run any of those scripts you see sitting around until after you've read them.

They do some things I'd rather not have done to my computer without me knowing.

download and build libtai http://cr.yp.to/libtai/libtai-0.60.tar.gz

copy *.h in libtai to /usr/local/include/

and copy libtai.a to /usr/local/lib
